Every class in Java is a subclass of the Object class. The Object class provides some methods 
that can be overridden by any class to customize its behavior. Here are the methods that can be overridden by any Object class:

equals(Object obj): 
This method is used to compare two objects for equality. By default, it checks if two objects are the same instance.

hashCode(): 
This method returns a hash code value for the object. By default, it returns a hash code based on the memory address of the object.

toString(): 
This method returns a string representation of the object. By default, it returns the class name followed by the memory address of the object.

clone(): 
This method creates and returns a copy of the object. By default, it throws a CloneNotSupportedException.

finalize(): 
This method is called by the garbage collector when the object is no longer referenced. By default, it does nothing.

By overriding these methods, you can customize the behavior of your classes to better suit your needs. 
For example, you can override the equals() and hashCode() methods to compare objects based on their contents rather than their memory addresses, 
and you can override the toString() method to provide a more informative string representation of your objects.

wait(): 
This method causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() or notifyAll() method 
on the same object. By default, it throws an IllegalMonitorStateException.

notify(): 
This method wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the object. By default, it throws an IllegalMonitorStateException.

notifyAll(): 
This method wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object. By default, it throws an IllegalMonitorStateException.

getClass(): 
This method returns the runtime class of the object. By default, it returns the class object for the object's class.

finalize(): 
This method is called by the garbage collector when the object is no longer referenced. By default, it does nothing.

wait(long timeout): 
This method causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() or notifyAll() method on the same object, or until the specified timeout has elapsed. 
By default, it throws an IllegalMonitorStateException.

wait(long timeout, int nanos): 
This method causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() or notifyAll() method on the same object, 
or until the specified timeout has elapsed. It also allows for a more precise timeout value in nanoseconds. By default, it throws an IllegalMonitorStateException.
